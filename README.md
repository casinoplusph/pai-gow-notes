# Pai Gow Notes

This is a quiet space for reflecting on the slower rhythms and thoughtful moments found in **Pai Gow**.

While often seen as just another tile-based game, Pai Gow offers an unexpected gift: it rewards patience over impulse, and strategy over spectacle.

## 🌱 Why This Matters

In a fast-moving world, Pai Gow reminds us to pause.

Every hand is a moment to think clearly, weigh options, and act with calm intention. It’s not just about winning—it's about how we respond to what’s dealt, and what we do with the time between moves.

## ✍️ Personal Note

> “The quiet games teach the loudest lessons.”

This is not a guide. It’s simply a notebook of small truths learned between tiles. Whether you play Pai Gow or simply live with intention, the lesson is the same: pace yourself—and stay present.
